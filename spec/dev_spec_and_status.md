## Project Overview
**Target**: MVP/POC Basketball Statistics Recording App
**Scope**: Solo mode only, 5-player teams, core statistics tracking
**Platform**: Android (Initial target)

---

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Android (Java/Kotlin)
- **Primary Database**: SQLite Database (local storage for all operations)
- **Cloud Backup/Sync**: Firebase Firestore (multi-device sync and backup)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
- **UI Framework**: Native Android XML layouts
- **Development Environment**: Android Studio
- **Cloud Platform**: Google Firebase (sync and authentication only)
- **Offline Support**: Full offline functionality with SQLite primary storage

### Database Schema

#### Cloud Backup/Sync (Firebase Firestore)
**Backup & Sync Storage**: Firebase Firestore mirrors SQLite data for cloud backup, multi-device synchronization, and data recovery.

**Firestore Collections Structure (Mirror of SQLite):**
- **`users`**: User authentication and profile data (synced from user_profile table)
- **`teams`**: League teams data (synced from teams table)
- **`team_players`**: Team player rosters (synced from team_players table)
- **`games`**: Scheduled and completed games (synced from games table)
- **`events`**: Game events and statistics (synced from events table)
- **`team_fouls`**: Team foul tracking (synced from team_fouls table)
- **`app_settings`**: User preferences (synced from app_settings table)

**Authentication**: Firebase Authentication handles user login, registration, and security.

**Sync Strategy**: SQLite primary → Firebase mirror for backup and multi-device access.

#### Primary Storage (SQLite Database)
**Storage Strategy**: SQLite as primary data store with Firebase sync for backup and multi-device access

```

### Firebase Integration Architecture

#### Authentication Flow
1. **User Registration/Login**: Firebase Authentication with email/password
2. **User Sessions**: Persistent login with automatic session management
3. **Security Rules**: Firestore security rules ensuring users only access their league data
4. **Guest Mode**: Optional anonymous authentication for demo purposes

#### Data Synchronization Strategy
1. **SQLite-Primary**: SQLite database as primary data store for all operations
2. **Firebase Backup/Sync**: Firebase Firestore as cloud backup and multi-device synchronization
3. **Offline-First**: App fully functional without internet connection
4. **Automatic Background Sync**: Background synchronization when network connectivity available
5. **Manual Sync**: User-triggered sync button on home screen for immediate synchronization
6. **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins with timestamp-based conflict resolution (manual sync: user device wins)
7. **Sync Queue**: Failed operations queued for retry when connectivity resumes

#### Real-Time Features
1. **Live Game Updates**: Firestore listeners for real-time score and event updates
2. **Multi-Device Sync**: Instant synchronization across user devices
3. **Spectator Mode**: Real-time game viewing for non-recorder users
4. **League Management**: Live updates when league administrators modify teams/games

#### Firebase Security Model
1. **User Isolation**: Each user has access only to their created leagues and games
2. **Role-Based Access**: League creators can invite others with specific permissions
3. **Data Validation**: Firebase security rules validate all data writes
4. **API Security**: All Firebase operations secured through authentication tokens

#### Manual Sync Implementation
**Location**: Sync button in top-left corner of home screen (Frame 1)
**Purpose**: User-controlled synchronization for offline-first workflow and conflict resolution

##### Sync Process Flow
1. **Initiate Sync**: User taps sync button → Visual feedback (rotating icon)
2. **Pull Phase**: Download all server changes from Firebase Firestore collections
3. **Merge Phase**: Compare server data with local SQLite cache timestamps
4. **Conflict Resolution**: **User Device Wins** - Local data overwrites server conflicts
5. **Push Phase**: Upload all local changes to Firebase Firestore
6. **Complete**: Visual feedback (green checkmark) and refresh UI with latest data

##### Conflict Resolution Strategy: "User Device Wins"
- **Philosophy**: Manual sync = user's intentional action to sync their current work
- **Implementation**: User's device timestamp always wins in conflicts
- **Benefits**: 
  - User has full control over their data
  - No data loss from user's current session
  - Clear, predictable behavior
- **Edge Cases**: 
  - Deleted items on server: Restore from user device if locally present
  - New items on server: Merge with local data (no conflicts)
  - Modified items: User device version overwrites server version

##### Sync Data Scope
- **Teams**: Add/edit/delete team information
- **Players**: Team roster changes (add/remove/edit players)
- **Games**: Schedule changes (add/edit/delete scheduled games) 
- **Game Events**: Live game statistics and event logs
- **User Preferences**: Settings and league configurations

##### Error Handling
- **Network Offline**: Show error state, queue sync for later
- **Firebase Authentication Failed**: Redirect to login
- **Partial Sync Failure**: Retry failed operations, show progress
- **Data Corruption**: Validate and restore from local cache

##### Performance Considerations
- **Incremental Sync**: Only sync data changed since last sync (timestamp-based)
- **Batch Operations**: Group related writes for efficiency
- **Background Processing**: Sync operations don't block UI
- **Progress Indication**: Show sync progress for large data sets

##### Visual Feedback States
- **Default**: Grey sync icon (ready to sync)
- **Syncing**: Blue rotating animation
- **Success**: Green checkmark (2 seconds)
- **Error**: Red warning icon with error message
- **Offline**: Greyed out with "offline" indicator

### App Architecture (MVC Pattern)

3. **LogActivity** - Event log viewing/editing *(Portrait orientation)*
4. **StatsActivity** - Statistics and reports *(Portrait orientation)*
5. **LeagueManagementActivity** - League setup and team/player management *(Portrait orientation)*
6. **~~GameRosterActivity~~** - *DEPRECATED: Functionality integrated into GameActivity as Setup Mode*
7. **~~SubstitutionActivity~~** - *DEPRECATED: Functionality integrated into Unified Player Selection Modal*

|         ├── Button (timeout)
|         ├── Button (personal foul) [RENAMED]
|         └── Button (substitution)
```

#### Typography & Spacing Standards (Mobile-Optimized)
```xml
<!-- Mobile-friendly text sizes -->
Main titles: 24sp (reduced from 32sp)
Section titles: 14sp (reduced from 18sp) 
Modal headers: 16sp (reduced from 20sp)
Button text: 10-11sp (reduced from 12-13sp)
Player numbers: 16sp (reduced from 18-20sp)
Player names: 10sp (reduced from 11sp)
Control panel text: 12sp (enhanced for timer visibility)

<!-- Compact spacing -->
Panel padding: 8-16dp (reduced from 20-24dp)
Button margins: 2dp (reduced from 3dp)
Layout margins: 4dp (reduced from 8dp)
Control panel height: Enhanced 2-row layout for better visibility
```

#### Color Coding Standards
```xml
<!-- colors.xml -->
<color name="selected_player">#2196F3</color>      <!-- Blue -->
<color name="inactive_button">#BDBDBD</color>      <!-- Light Grey -->
<color name="active_button">#4CAF50</color>        <!-- Green -->
<color name="team_foul_normal">#000000</color>     <!-- Black -->
<color name="team_foul_penalty">#F44336</color>    <!-- Red (5+ fouls) -->
<color name="event_highlight">#2196F3</color>      <!-- Blue (3 sec flash) -->
```

#### Button Sizing Guidelines (Mobile-Optimized)
- **Player Cards**: 48dp height (reduced from 58dp) for regular cards
- **Modal Player Cards**: 75dp x 50dp (reduced from 100dp x 64dp) - 25% smaller for narrow screens
- **Event Buttons**: Auto-sized with reduced margins (2dp instead of 3dp)  
- **Control Buttons**: 32dp height (reduced from 36dp)
- **Modal Buttons**: 44dp height (reduced from 48dp)
- **Minimum Touch Target**: 48dp (Android accessibility standard) - maintained for tap areas
- **Spacing**: Reduced margins - 4dp panel margins (was 8dp), 2dp button margins (was 3dp)

#### Player Selection Modal Optimizations (Narrow Screen Support)
- **Layout**: Scrollable rows of 4 players (was fixed 3x4 grid) for better narrow screen compatibility
